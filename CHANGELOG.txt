Migrate 2.0 dev
==================

Features and enhancements
- #1039882 - Pass client migration to stub creation. Note that $migration->values
  (the destination object being built) is now $migration->destinationValues - any
  migrations referencing this member will need to change.
- #946350 - Accept arrays in sourceMigration();
Let a node migration set node_revisions.uid. That's the 'last edited by' user

Bug fixes
- #1028824 - Errors during registry rebuild trigger fatal error.
Fix highwater handling to deal with duplicate values.
- #998604 - Fixed dedupe.
- #998586 - Improved feedback for disabled migrations.
- #972382 - Fix MigrateDestinationTableCopy.
- #962120 - Support idlist on rollback.
- #1017256 - Document case-sensitivity in beer.inc.
- #1013844 - Better error handling in getInstance().
- #1008228 - migrate_example broken by list changes in D7 RC3.

Migrate 2.0 Beta 3
==================

Features and enhancements

- #989200 - Support "dynamic" migrations. Changes to be aware of:
  All modules implementing migration classes must now implement hook_migrate_api()
    (see migrate_migrate_api() for an example).
  Dependencies and sourceMigrations must now be expressed in terms of 
    machine name rather than class name.
  MigrationBase::getInstance now takes a machine name rather than a class name. 
  Migration class names are no longer required to end in 'Migration'.
- #992898 - Pass options to source and destination constructors as arrays.
File destinations (i.e., migrating directly to the file_managed table, with
  option copying of the files themselves) are now supported.
Allow migration of comment enable/disable.
Check max_execution_time as well as memory_limit, for graceful exit when
  max_execution_time is in play.
Add dedupe() method for a field mapping.
Apply MigrateBase::timestamp() to comment created/changed

Bug fixes

needs_update => needs-update to match drush conventions.
- #959400 - Better way to get vid for vocabulary.
- #984336 - Additional fields and vocabularies not reported on migration info page
- #990960 - Initialize fields array for profiles
